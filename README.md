# Indent Horizon SvelteKit Code Editor/Client

## What is Indent Horizon?

Indent Horizon is a community-hosted massively multiplayer spaceship coding game. The game strives to be fun for both veteran computer programmers **and also** beginners.

This repo contains a implementation of the game client written in svelte.

If you are interested in hosting your own shard then go to [this repository](https://github.com/ikealmighty/indenthorizon-shard).

## Game Design

### Concept

Players program individual "ship programs" that command spaceships. Spaceships can mine resources, explore solar systems (each community hosted shard usually represents a single solar system), trade with other ships, attack other spaceships, send messages to ships within a range, build new ships, upgrade equipment, and do "research" on raw materials mined throughout the game.
